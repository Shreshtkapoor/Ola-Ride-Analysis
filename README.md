### **SQL Analysis & Insights**  
The following SQL queries were used to extract key insights from the data:  

1. **Successful Bookings**: Identified all rides that were completed successfully.  
2. **Ride Distance Analysis**: Calculated the average ride distance for each vehicle type.  
3. **Cancellations by Customers & Drivers**: Found reasons for ride cancellations and their frequency.  
4. **Top Customers**: Ranked the top 5 customers based on the number of bookings.  
5. **Driver & Customer Ratings**: Analyzed rating distributions across different vehicle types.  
6. **Revenue Analysis**: Computed total booking value for successful rides.  
7. **Payment Methods**: Retrieved rides where payments were made using UPI.  
8. **Incomplete Rides**: Examined incomplete rides along with the reasons for non-completion.
